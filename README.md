# Eight Queens Problem

This is a rough implementation (re-creation) of my first attempt at solving the problem.
My first attempt was in Java, in 1998, and I had a visual component to it as well.
The computing power was pretty poor, and the program would run for several minutes before computing all the results.
Hence, I had a display shown that would show how many solutions were computed so far, and would accept key strokes to move between the found solutions.

This attempt finds the solutions and prints them out to the console.
It is pretty imperative, and not test driven.
